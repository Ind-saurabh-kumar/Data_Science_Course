    "# Five important ways for Imputing Missing Values \n",
    "\n",
    "You can impute missing valued uisng machine learning models. This process is known as data imputation and is commonly used in data preprocessing to handle missing or incomplete data. Tehre are several methods and models you can use, depending on the nature of your data and the missing values;\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Simple Imputation Techniques:`\n",
    "    - **Mean/Median Imputation:**: Replace missing values with the mean or median of the column. Suitable for numerical data. \n",
    "    - **Mode Imputation:** Replace missing values with the mode (most requent value) of the column. Useful for categorical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `K-nearest Neighbors (KNN):` This algorithm can be usie to impute missing values base don the similarity of rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Regression Imputation:` Use a regression model to predict the missing vlaues base don other variables in your dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Decision Trees and Random Forests:` These can handle missing values inherently. They can alos be uded to predict missin valued based on the patterns learned form the other data. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Advanced Techniques:`\n",
    "    - **Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations(Mice):** This is a moere sphisticated technique that models each variable withmissing values as a function of other variables in a round-robin fashion. \n",
    "    - **Deep Learning Methods:** Neural networks, especially autoencoders, can be effective in imputing missing values in complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ` Time Series Specific Methods:` For time-series data, you might use techniques like interpolatio forware-fill, or bacward-fill. \n",
